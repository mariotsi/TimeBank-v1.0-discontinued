TimeBank-v1.0-discontinued
==========================

First version of TimeBank back end in Java and front end in PHP

This version was used as project for the Opened and Distribuited Systems exam at the University of Perugia in the 2013.

In August of 2014 I started to rewrite the entire project back end with Python+Django+DRF and adapt the front end to work with newly created RESTfull endpoints
